# Data-curation tools

The tools to prepare the open data portal records are in [the data-curation repository](https://github.com/cernopendata/data-curation) in the CERN Open data GitHub area. Each experiment has specific tools and those for CMS are
- scripts to prepare the collision data records (cms-NNNN-collision-datasets)
- scripts to prepare the information about the triggers (event selection at data taking)
- scripts to prepare the simulated data records, the most relevant one being [cms-YYYY-simulated-datasets](https://github.com/cernopendata/data-curation/tree/master/cms-YYYY-simulated-datasets)

Some of the scripts were used only for the early releases ("cod2") and are not in use any more.
