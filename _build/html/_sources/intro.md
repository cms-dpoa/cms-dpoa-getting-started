# Getting started in CMS DPOA

Welcome to the Data preservation and open access (DPOA) project in the CMS experiment! If you are new to the project, these pages guide you through some tutorial material that you may find useful in your work. It also lists the entry points to get started with different DPOA-related tasks. 

## Tutorial material

The tutorial material on computing tools comes mainly from two excellent sources:
- [the HEP software foundation tutorials](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/training/curriculum) (CC BY 4.0)
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education from MIT]( https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)


## Personal induction project

We will build a personal induction project for you depending on your skills and according to your tasks in DPOA. You will go through tutorials on basic computing skills in the areas you are not familiar with and then continue with specific tools needed in your DPOA work. Your progress with your induction project tasks can be followed as a GitHub project board.
