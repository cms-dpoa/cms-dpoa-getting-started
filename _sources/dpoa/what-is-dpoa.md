# What is DPOA

The data preservation and open access group in the CMS experiment has the mandate to manage the implementation of [the CMS data preservation, re-use and open access policy](https://cms-docdb.cern.ch/cgi-bin/PublicDocDB/RetrieveFile?docid=6032&filename=CMSDataPolicy-v1.3.pdf&version=3).
We develop and promote measures to ensure preservation and reusability of data (in the wide sense of the term) in CMS, both within the collaboration and for external users.

The key activities of the group are
- tools to improve analysis reusability and reproducibility
- development of the CMS interface to [the CERN analysis preservation platform (CAP)](https://analysispreservation.cern.ch/)
- preparing regular data releases through [the CERN open data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/)
- providing documentation and examples for using CMS open data
- developing a legacy data format for Run1 (2010--2012) data comparable to the "NanoAOD" data format in use since Run2.
